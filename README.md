# Cl2-chisel(Developing)

Cl2-chisel is a low-power MCU(Micro Control Unit)-level processor based on Chisel6, built by `mill`.

Currently supporting RV32I/M/C.

## Sub-directories Overview

```shell
cl2-chisel
|-cl2/src						// Source Code
|--cc							// For Verilator Simulation
|--scala						// Chisel Code
|-example						// Simple AM Environment
|-scripts						
|-utils							
|-vsrc							// Store Verilog Generated by mill
|-Makefile
```

## Compile chisel

Install `mill`. We recommend using Mill v0.11.5.

Run `make verilog` to generate verilog code. The output file is `./vsrc`.

## Simulation

We use `Verilator` for simulation, with the related stimulus tests stored in `./src/cc`.

Run `make sim` to launch simulation by `verilator_sim.mk` in `./scripts`. The default image is dummy.

You can either use our ready-to-run image for simulation or build image yourself in `AM project`.
